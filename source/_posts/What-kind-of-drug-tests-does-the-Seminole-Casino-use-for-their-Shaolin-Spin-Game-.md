#  What kind of drug tests does the Seminole Casino use for their Shaolin Spin Game? 

The Seminole Casino in Florida uses several different drug tests for their Shaolin Spin game. The tests that they use are the standard five panel drug test, the twelve panel drug test, and the expanded opioids drug test. 

The five panel drug test is the most common type of drug test and it screens for marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, and PCP. The twelve panel drug test screens for all of the drugs that are in the five panel drug test plus barbiturates, benzodiazepines, methadone, propoxyphene, and tricyclic antidepressants. The expanded opioids drug test screens for all of the drugs that are in the five and twelve panel drug tests plus hydrocodone, oxycodone, and methadone.
