# What Happens When the Dealer and Player Tie in Blackjack - Insights from Zola

Ã‰mile Zola was a famous French novelist who lived during the 19th century. Although he did not have direct insights on the game of blackjack, his emphasis on realism and attention to detail can be applied to understanding what happens when the dealer and player tie in blackjack. In this article, we will explore some key strategies and insights from Zola on what happens when the dealer and player tie in blackjack.

## The Basics of Blackjack

Blackjack is a card game that is played with one or more decks of standard playing cards. The objective of the game is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand value without going over 21, which is called "busting."

Each card in the deck is assigned a point value, with numbered cards being worth their face value, face cards (kings, queens, and jacks) being worth 10 points each, and aces being worth either one or 11 points, depending on which value is more favorable for the player.

## What Happens When the Dealer and Player Tie in Blackjack

When the dealer and player tie in blackjack, it is called a "push." This means that neither the player nor the dealer wins or loses the hand, and the player's bet is returned to them. 

For example, if a player bets $10 and their hand value is 17, and the dealer's hand value is also 17, then it is a push and the player receives their $10 bet back.

It is important to note that in some casinos or variations of blackjack, a push may result in the player losing their bet. Therefore, it is important to pay attention to the specific rules of the game before placing bets.

## Key Strategies for Winning at Blackjack

Some key strategies for winning at blackjack include:

1. Knowing when to hit, stand, double down, or split based on the total point value of your hand and the dealer's face-up card.
2. Keeping track of the cards that have been played, to gain insight into which cards are still in play and which ones are not.
3. Setting a budget for your bets and sticking to it.
