#  How to crate online casino game from scratch

In this tutorial we are going to create a simple blackjack game from scratch.

First, we need to create the basic structure of our game. This will include the main game window, and the blackjack table itself.

<style> #game-window { width: 640px; height: 480px; } .blackjack-table { width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 1px solid black; } </style> <div id="game-window"> <div class="blackjack-table"></div> </div>

Now that we have the basic structure in place, let's start adding some functionality. We'll need to create a way for players to input their bets, and then track their cards and resulting score.

We'll also need to add some basic animation so that the game feels more alive. For example, when cards are dealt we can randomly select one of two possible animations to play.

To start with, let's add some variables to keep track of our player's information:

var player1 = null; var player2 = null; var bet = 0; var cards = []; var score = 0;

Next, let's create a function to handle input from the player. This function will take two parameters - the amount of money they want to bet, and whether they want to hit or stand.

function handleInput(amount, action) { // Check if input is valid if (amount >= 0 && amount <= 100) { // If yes, then update bet and return if (action === "hit") { bet += amount; } else { score += amount; } return true; } else { // Otherwise display an error message console.log("Invalid input."); } }

Next, let's add code to deal the cards. We'll use a random number generator to choose between two different animations. The first animation will deal the first card face up, and the second animation will deal the second card face down. We'll also need to keep track of which card is which so that we can update the player's information accordingly.

function dealCards() { // Create a new array to store our Card objects var cards1 = []; // Deal the first card using Animation A var firstCard = document.createElement("div"); firstCard.className = "card"; firstCard.innerHTML = "A"; cards1.push(firstCard); // Deal the second card using Animation B var secondCard = document.createElement("div"); secondCard.className = "card"; secondCard.innerHTML = "2"; cards1[cards1.length - 1].appendChild(secondCard); // Get a random number between 0 and 1 var randNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2); // If RANDOM number is equal to 0 if (randNum === 0) { // Use Animation A for dealing card document.getElementById("card-animation").src="url/to/card-animation-a .gif"; } else { // Use Animation B for dealing card document.getElementById("card-animation").src="url/to/card-animation-b .gif"; } }


Now that we have basic gameplay functionality in place, let's add some finishing touches such as sound effects and winning/losing messages. We'll also need to keep track of how many rounds have been played so that we can show a leaderboard at the end of the game.

 Here's all the code needed to handle those final touches: 

 function playSoundEffect() { if (bet > 0) { document.getElementsByClassName("sound-effect")[0].play(); } }; function showWinningMessage() { document.getElementsByClassName("message")[0].innerHTML = "<h4>You win!</h4> Your score was " + score + "<br />Number of rounds played: " + roundsPlayed(); }; function showLosingMessage() { document .getElementsByClassName("message")[0].innerHTML = "<h4>You lose!</h4><p>Your score was " + score + "<br />Number of rounds played: " + roundsPlayed(); }; function updateScoreboard() { document .getElementsByClassName("scoreboard")[0].innerHTML = "<strong>" + ScoreBoardHeader + "</strong><br />Player 1: " + player1 + "<br />Player 2: " + player2; }; function resetGame() { player1 = null; player2=null; bet=0; score=0; roundsPlayed=0;}

 Finally, we need to call all these functions when appropriate in order for everything to work correctly.</pre>

#  How to use Unity to create online casino game 

Unity is a powerful game engine that can be used to create a wide variety of games. In this article, we will look at how to use Unity to create an online casino game.

The first step is to create a new project in Unity. Next, we need to add a 3D plane to the scene. This will be used as the playing area for our casino game.

Next, we need to add some basic objects to the scene. These objects will represent the different pieces of furniture in a casino: a table, a chair, and two lamps. We can place these objects by dragging them from the toolbar onto the 3D plane.

We also need to add some basic tokens to the scene. These tokens will represent the different types of casino chips: white, red, and blue. We can add these tokens by selecting GameObject > Create Other > 3D Object > Cube from the menu bar.

Next, we need to create a new C# script and name it "TokenController". This script will control the behavior of our tokens. It will also provide methods that can be used to change their color and state.

using UnityEngine; using System.Collections; public class TokenController : MonoBehaviour { public Color tokenColor = Color.white; public enum State { Inactive, Active } // Use this method to change the color of a token void SetTokenColor(int index, Color newColor) { foreach (var token in GetComponentsInChildren<Token>()) { token.tokenColor = newColor; } } // Use this method to set the state of a token void SetTokenState(int index, State newState) { foreach (var token in GetComponentsInChildren<Token>()) { token.state = newState; } } }

We now need to add this script to our tokens. We can do this by selecting each token in turn and adding it as a component in the inspector window. We then need to select TokenController from the Script drop-down list.

Now that our scene is setup, let's take a look at how we can create the gameplay for our online casino game. The first thing we need is some way of representing the player's current score. We can do this by creating a new C# script and naming it "ScoreController". This script will keep track of the player's current score and will also provide methods that can be used to increase or decrease it.

using UnityEngine; using System.Collections; public class ScoreController : MonoBehaviour { private int score = 0; // Use this method to increase the player's score void IncrementScore() { score++; } // Use this method to decrease the player's score void DecrementScore() { score--; } // Returns true if the player has won bool IsWinner() { return (score >= 21); } }

We now need to add this script to our scene. We can do this by selecting Main Camera in the Hierarchy window and adding ScoreController as a component in the inspector window.

Now that we have our scoring system setup, let's take a look at how we can implement gameplay mechanics for our online casino game. The first thing we need is some way of calculating whether or not the player has won or lost bets placed on different colors of chips. We can do this by adding a new C# script and naming it "ChipMatchController". This script will keep track of all bets placed on different colors of chips and will determine whether or not they have been matched correctly based on their current state and color values. It will also provide methods that can be used to place bets and update chip states.


using UnityEngine; using System; using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; public class ChipMatchController : MonoBehaviour { List<BET> bets = new List<BET>(); // Use this method to place a bet on one color chip void PlaceBet(int amount, Color chipColor) { var bet = new BET(); bet._amount = amount; bet._chipColor = chipColor; bets .Add(bet); } // Use this methodto updatethe stateofa color chipvoid UpdateChipState(int index, State oldState, State newState) { var chip =GetComponentInChildren<Token>(); switch (newState) { case State .Inactive: chip .tokenColor= oldState ; break ; case State .Active: if (! CompareChipsStates(chip .tokenColor ,oldState ,newState )){ chip .tokenText=" (NOT MATCHED)";} else{chip .tokenText=" MATCHED!";} break ; default: break ; } } bool CompareChipsStates( Color oldChipcolor , Color newChipcolor ){return oldChipcolor ==

3. Market your game online. There are a number of ways you can do this, including social media, paid advertising, and search engine optimization (SEO). Figure out which marketing channels work best for you and focus on them.

4. Monetize your game with in-game purchases. One of the most popular ways to monetize a game is by selling virtual items or upgrades within the game itself. This can be anything from new levels or maps to special clothing or weapons for your characters. Experiment with different monetization strategies until you find one that works best for your game.
