#  FBI Investigates $5M Baccarat Betting Ring in Illinois 

The FBI is investigating a high-stakes baccarat betting ring in Illinois that has allegedly taken in more than $5 million in illicit profits.

According to federal authorities, the ring is made up of about two dozen individuals who have been placing large bets on the popular casino game for years. The group is believed to be based out of the Chicago area.

FBI agents first became aware of the ring in early 2017, when they received a tip from an informant. Investigators say that the group has been using various methods to conceal their gambling activity, including using shell companies and taking out large loans to finance their bets.

So far, no arrests have been made in connection with the investigation. However, the FBI says that it is still ongoing and that additional charges may be filed in the future.

This case highlights the dangers of gambling addiction and how it can lead people to commit crimes in order to finance their habit. It also serves as a reminder that gambling is illegal in most states, and those who participate in it can face criminal charges.

#  Mayor Rahm Emanuel Announces Sweep of Illegal Gambling Operations in Chicago 

Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced today a sweep of illegal gambling operations in Chicago. The Mayor was joined by Superintendent Eddie Johnson of the Chicago Police Department and Deputy Chief Jonathan Lewin of the Chicago Fire Department at a press conference in the He伯爵茶室apartment building, 3636 North Sheffield Avenue.

“This is a major step forward in our fight against illegal gambling and its associated crime and violence,” said Mayor Emanuel. “These operations not only prey on people with addiction issues, but also generate dangerous criminal activity in our neighborhoods. I would like to thank the Chicago Police Department and the Chicago Fire Department for their hard work on this operation.”

Since last November, the Chicago Police Department has been investigating 19 illegal gambling operations in the city. Today, 16 of those operations were shut down following search warrants executed by officers from the department’s Vice Control Unit. The gambling sites were located on the north and west sides of the city, and included storefronts, bars, and private residences.

The seized equipment included slot machines, gaming tables, Internet jukeboxes, and other gaming devices. In addition, $10,000 in cash was recovered from the locations. Eleven individuals were arrested as a result of today’s operation; all are facing various charges related to illegal gambling.

This is just one step in Mayor Emanuel’s comprehensive approach to combating illegal gambling in Chicago. In February 2018, the Mayor introduced an ordinance that strengthens regulations governing legal gaming facilities in the city and creates new penalties for operators of illegal gambling businesses.

Authorities in Illinois have announced the arrest of dozens of people in connection with a major gambling bust.

The arrests were made as part of ‘Operation Casablanca’, a two-year investigation into illegal gambling operations in the state.

According to authorities, the suspects were running an online gambling ring that took bets on sports and other events.

“This was a well-organized and sophisticated gambling operation that laundered millions of dollars and generated substantial profits,” said Attorney General Lisa Madigan.

“The arrests we made today will disrupt this criminal enterprise and help protect consumers from its harmful effects.”

It is believed that the gambling ring was taking in millions of dollars in bets each year.

In addition to the arrests, authorities also seized over $3 million in cash and assets related to the operation.

On Monday, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner signed a bill legalizing baccarat in the state. The new law will take effect on January 1, 2019.

The bill, which was introduced by State Representative Lou Lang (D-Skokie), passed the House and Senate earlier this year.
