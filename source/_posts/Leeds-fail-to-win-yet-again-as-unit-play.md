#  Leeds fail to win yet again as unit play

A tale of two cities. The beautiful, bustling city of Leeds, and the struggling unitary authority of the same name.

Leeds has failed to win a single game in their last nine attempts, and sit one place above the relegation zone in the Championship table. Manager Paul Heckingbottom is under pressure to turn things around, with many fans calling for his dismissal.

The main issue for Leeds seems to be their lack of scoring power. They've only managed to score fourteen goals in twenty-six games this season, with Kemar Roofe currently leading the team with six goals. Other teams in the division have been far more prolific, with Bristol City scoring thirty-eight goals and Wolverhampton Wanderers scoring forty-one.

There have been some bright spots for Leeds this season. Pablo Hernandez has been in excellent form, providing seven assists and three goals. Fellow midfielder Eunan O'Kane has also impressed, chipping in with two goals and two assists from midfield. However, these individual performances have not been enough to help the team win games.

The next few games will be crucial for Leeds. A win against Norwich City on Saturday could help them climb out of the relegation zone, but a defeat would see them fall further behind their rivals.

#  Another unsuccessful unit play for Leeds

## After a promising first season back in the Championship following promotion from League One, Leeds are struggling again this term and sit just outside of the relegation zone.

Ahead of their home game against strugglers Bolton Wanderers, there was talk of a must-win for both sides but it was the visitors who came away with all three points.

Leeds created very few clear-cut chances and their best opportunity came from Ezgjan Alioski whose strike was well saved by Ben Amos in the Bolton goal.

The Trotters took the lead on the stroke of half-time when Karl Henry's free-kick found Craig Noone unmarked at the back post and he was able to head home.

After the break, Wanderers doubled their lead when goalscorer Noone teed up Sammy Ameobi to lash home from close range.

There was no way back for Leeds and they slumped to a 2-0 defeat which leaves them just two points above the relegation zone.

#  Unit play payoff for Leeds fans

The fan protest at the Elland Road club last season was frustrating for all parties involved. The team had a terrible year, finishing in 14th place in the Championship, and the demonstrations from fans did nothing to help.

Now that things have calmed down, it’s important to take a step back and analyze what happened. It’s clear that there were some serious underlying problems with the club, and fixing them will not be easy.

One of the biggest issues was the way that owner Massimo Cellino ran the team. His chaotic management style created a lot of tension and discord within the squad, and it clearly affected their performance on the field.

Another problem was the lack of investment in the squad. Cellino refused to spend any significant money on new players, which resulted in a very weak team. This was particularly evident in the defense, where Leeds conceded more goals than any other team in the Championship.

Clearly, there are some major issues that need to be addressed if Leeds are going to get back on track. The new ownership group led by Andrea Radrizzani needs to work hard to repair the damage that has been done.

There is no quick fix solution, but investing in new players and hiring a quality manager are two good places to start. If they can get things moving in the right direction, then there is no reason why Leeds can’t make a return to the Premier League in the near future.

#  A successful unit play for Leeds

Early in the 1902-1903 season, Leeds United AFC were having trouble scoring goals. Their first match of the season resulted in a 0-0 draw against Burton United. Manager David Ashworth decided to try a new strategy: a unit play.

The unit play consisted of three forwards and one midfielder. This formation allowed the midfield to help out defensively while still being able to create chances for the forwards. The gamble paid off, and Leeds went on to win 5-1 against Grimsby Town.

This success continued throughout the season, and Leeds finished in 3rd place in the league. The unit play was so successful that it is still used today by many teams around the world.

#  Leeds United clinch unit play victory

It was an intense and nervy match at Elland Road as Leeds United clinched a 3-1 victory over Nottingham Forest to ensure their place in the Championship play-offs. Pontus Jansson’s early opener was cancelled out by Jack Colback, but second-half goals from Mateusz Klich and Tyler Roberts ensured that Bielsa’s side will take their place in the top six.

Leeds made the perfect start, taking the lead within three minutes. Ezgjan Alioski’s superb cross found Jansson unmarked at the back post, and he powered a header past Costel Pantilimon. The hosts were dominant in the early stages, but Forest gradually settled into the game and equalised in stunning fashion on 26 minutes. Ben Watson’s long throw was flicked on by Matty Cash, and Colback arrived late at the back post to volley home off the underside of the bar.

The promotion race is always a nervy affair, and there were few clear-cut chances in a cagey second half until Klich broke free and fired home from 20 yards on 73 minutes. Roberts sealed the win with a fine solo goal in stoppage time, beating several defenders before firing low past Pantilimon to send the home fans into raptures.

It was an important victory for Leeds, who now find themselves just two points behind fourth-placed Derby County with three games remaining. They will be hoping to secure their place in next season’s Premier League with wins against Birmingham City, Wigan Athletic and Brentford.
