According to reports, Rowan Atkinson won $15.8 million playing baccarat at a London casino this weekend. The British actor and comedian was apparently in town for a performance of his show "Quartermaine's Terms" when he decided to take a break and play some cards.

Atkinson has been known to enjoy gambling in the past – he once lost £1 million playing blackjack – so his big win this weekend probably comes as no surprise. It's unclear exactly how much money the actor started with, but it's safe to say he walked away a very happy man.

This isn't the first time Atkinson has won big at a casino. In 2012, he took home £4.3 million from a poker game in Las Vegas. Clearly, the man knows how to gamble – and win!

It will be interesting to see if Atkinson decides to splash out on any new toys with his latest winnings, or if he'll choose to invest them instead. Either way, we're sure he's enjoying his moment in the sun!

#  Billionaire row: how Rowan Atkinson became a baccarat winner

Legendary comedic actor Rowan Atkinson is well known for his roles in popular sitcoms such as ‘Mr Bean’ and ‘Blackadder’. What is perhaps less well known is that he is also an accomplished baccarat player, with a string of big wins to his name.

Baccarat is a casino game that is thought to have originated in Italy in the 15th century. It is a high stakes game that typically attracts wealthy players, and Atkinson has been known to enjoy a game or two at some of the world’s most exclusive casinos.

In 2006, Atkinson won £1.5 million playing baccarat at London’s Ritz casino. The win was particularly impressive as it came against some of the casino’s top players. The following year, he scooped another £1 million jackpot at the same casino.

Atkinson’s success at baccarat has not been limited to London casinos either – he has also won big pots in Macau, Monaco and Las Vegas. In total, it is thought that he has won around £7 million playing the game.

So how does Atkinson achieve such success at baccarat? Well, according to him, it’s all about keeping things simple: “You don’t need to be a maths genius to play baccarat – you just need common sense and a bit of luck.”

Clearly, this approach has worked well for him so far! If you want to try your hand at baccarat yourself, there are plenty of online casinos where you can do so (just make sure you stick to reputable operators). However, be warned – like any casino game, baccarat can be addictive, so please gamble responsibly!

Daredevil British actor Rowan Atkinson has cashed in on a $16 million baccarat windfall, according to reports in the British press.

Atkinson, who is best known for his work on the hit sitcom 'Mr. Bean', was playing at London's exclusive Crockfords casino when he struck it lucky, winning more than £10 million ($16 million) in a single night.

A regular at the high-rolling casino, Atkinson is said to have been playing baccarat on a VIP table when he won big. The win marks the biggest ever payout at Crockfords, and comes just days after the casino was sold to Malaysian gaming giant Genting Resorts for £225 million ($362 million).

Speaking about his windfall, Atkinson said he was "delighted" with the win and planned to put it all towards his "life's pleasures".

"It will make a big difference to my life's pleasures," he told reporters. "I'm very fortunate."

The 61-year-old actor is no stranger to big wins – he previously scooped a $1.5 million jackpot playing blackjack at Las Vegas' Caesars Palace casino.
