#  10 Tips to Help You Win at Deuces Wild Video Poker 

Are you looking to improve your chances of winning at Deuces Wild video poker? If so, then you’re in luck! Here are 10 tips that can help you achieve just that:

Tip #1: Bet Max
Always bet the maximum amount of coins allowed when playing Deuces Wild video poker. This is the best way to increase your chances of winning.

Tip #2: Know Your Payouts
Before you start playing, make sure you know the payout schedule for Deuces Wild video poker. This will help you make informed decisions about how to play your hands.

Tip #3: Hold Winners and Draw Losers
In general, you should hold any cards that rank as a winner and draw any cards that rank as a loser. However, there are some exceptions to this rule, so make sure you know the specific payouts for your game.

Tip #4: Watch the Deuces
The deuces (2s) are wild in Deuces Wild video poker and can be used to create winning hands. Keep an eye on these cards and be sure to use them when possible.

Tip #5: Maximize Your Winnings with 3-of-a-Kinds
In Deuces Wild video poker, 3-of-a-kinds always pay off big. Try to get as many of these as possible to maximize your winnings.

Tip #6: Be Patient   Sometimes it’s better to just wait for the right hand rather than going all in on a bad hand. Be patient and wait for the right opportunity before betting big. 
7 Keep an Eye on the Odds  Just like in any other type of gambling game, it’s important to keep an eye on the odds in Deuces Wild video poker. This will help you make better decisions about when to hold or draw cards.  

 Tip 8 Split Aces and Eights If you have an Ace and an 8, split them up and play each card as if it were a separate hand. This increases your chances of winning by giving you two shots at making a good hand. 

 Tip 9 Beware of Suited Royal Flushes While suited royal flushes are definitely something to shoot for, they also come with a pretty hefty price tag. So don’t be too quick to dump all your remaining chips into one hand just because it has a royal flush potential – especially if there are other high value hands still waiting to be played out.

 Tip 10 Use Strategy Tables Strategy tables can be a great tool for beginners who are new to Deuces Wild video poker. They provide a step-by-step guide on how to play each possible hand according to expected value – helping you make informed decisions about which cards to hold and which ones to discard

#  How to Play Deuces Wild for Beginners 

With the game of Deuces Wild, if you are beginner it can be a confusing experience. In this article we explain the basics in order to help you play and enjoy the game.

To start with, Deuces Wild is a poker game that uses a regular deck of 52 cards. However, in Deuces Wild four of the cards are wild – hence the name. This means that these Wild cards can be used to represent any other card in the deck to create winning hands.

When playing Deuces Wild you will need to place your bets before the cards are dealt. The bets available will typically be based on the number of coins you wish to bet per hand. So, for example, if you want to bet two coins then there will be two betting options – one for betting on heads and one for betting on tails.

Once all players have placed their bets, the dealer will then deal five cards face down to each player. After that, the dealer will turn over one of his five cards and this will become the ‘flop’ or opening hand. The objective is then to make the best 5 card hand possible using either your five cards or any combination of your five cards and the flop. 

If you have a pair of deuces (two 2s) in your hand then these are automatically classed as a wild card and can be used as any other card in order to make a winning hand. If you don’t have a pair of deuces then your other three cards are just like any other three random cards from the deck. 

One important thing to note about Deuces Wild is that there is no such thing as a ‘natural royal flush’. In other words, if you get a royal flush with no wilds then this is not counted as a win (although it is still an impressive hand). 

The best possible hand in Deuces Wild is Five Aces (Ace, Ace, Ace, Ace, King). As with most poker games, straights and flushes are also valuable hands so it’s worth keeping an eye out for these when playing Deuces Wild. 

Now that you know the basics of how to play Deuces Wild we hope you’ll give it a try!
