#  Indiana couple hosts unique bingo game at their wedding reception 

A bingo game is not what typically comes to mind when planning a wedding reception, but for one Indiana couple, it was the perfect way to entertain their guests. Lindsay and Brandon hosted a unique bingo game at their wedding reception and it was a hit!

The bride and groom printed out bingo cards with various wedding-related items listed on them (such as "Bride's veil being worn by someone other than the bride" or "Groom puts ring on wrong hand"). They then called out different items and had guests mark them off on their cards as they happened. Whoever got five in a row first won a prize.

Lindsay said that the game was a lot of fun and that everyone seemed to enjoy it. She added that it was a great way to keep people entertained during the reception. If you're looking for something different to do at your wedding reception, why not try hosting a bingo game? It's sure to be a hit!

#  How to play bridal bingo at your next wedding reception 

Bridal bingo is a great way to keep your guests entertained at your wedding reception. Here’s how to play:

1. Print out the bridal bingo game cards provided below. There are 30 cards in total, and you can either print them all out or print just a few depending on how many guests you have.

2. Distribute the cards to your guests.

3. Instruct your guests to mark off any squares that are called out during the reception.

4. The first guest to mark off all of their squares wins!

Bride and Groom: 
This square is pretty self-explanatory – simply cross off the bride and groom squares when they appear onstage.

Wedding Party: 
The wedding party is another easy one to spot – just cross off the squares for the bride, groom, maid of honor, best man, etc. as they come onstage.

Cake: 
Watch for the cake cutting scene and then cross off the square afterwards. You might also want to provide a designated “cake watcher” who can keep an eye out for this square and mark it off as soon as it’s cut.

Dance Floor: 
When the dance floor fills up, cross off this square! Dancing is a big part of most weddings so this will be one of the squares that’s crossed off quickly.

Toasts: 

The speeches can often be pretty long – just cross off this square whenever someone gets up to toast the happy couple.

#  Indiana bride and groom host bingo game at their wedding 

When Becca and Wes got married in May, they wanted to do something different than the traditional dance floor. They decided to host a bingo game for their guests. "We both like bingo, and it's something that not a lot of people do at weddings," Becca said.

The bride and groom set up six different bingo sheets with different prizes for each one. Prizes ranged from bottles of champagne to gift cards. They also made sure there was a variety of games, including traditional bingo, blackout bingo, and three-in-a-row bingo.

"People had so much fun playing," Becca said. "Even our older guests were getting into it." The bride and groom even took a few turns playing themselves.

If you're looking for something unique to do at your wedding, why not host a bingo game? It's sure to be a hit with your guests!

#  Learn how to play bridal bingo like a pro! 

There’s no need to worry if you’ve never played bridal bingo before. This guide will teach you everything you need to know to have a blast at your next wedding!

First, let’s start with the basics. What is bridal bingo? Bridal bingo is a game that is typically played at weddings. The object of the game is to collect as many items on your bingo card as possible. The first person to get five in a row wins!

Now that you know what bridal bingo is, let’s learn how to play. The game typically starts when the bride and groom enter the reception hall. Guests can then start playing by marking off items on their cards as they see them. There are typically different items that can be found at weddings, such as a garter, wedding program, cake slice, etc.

One important thing to keep in mind while playing bridal bingo is that players can only mark off an item once. So, if someone else marks off an item on your card, you can no longer mark it off yourself.

The game typically wraps up when the bride and groom cut the cake. The first person to mark off five items in a row (or whoever has the most items marked off) wins!

If you’re looking for some tips on how to win at bridal bingo, here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. Pay attention to what’s happening around you! Keep an eye out for items that might be on your card, such as a garter or wedding program.

2. Remember that players can only mark off an item once. If someone else marks it off for you, you can’t go back and mark it off again.

3. Marking an item off your card doesn’t mean you have to take it home with you! If someone hands you something that’s on your card, feel free to put it down and move on.
The most important thing while playing bridal bingo is to have fun! So don’t worry if you don’t win – just enjoy the festivities and celebrate with the other guests!
