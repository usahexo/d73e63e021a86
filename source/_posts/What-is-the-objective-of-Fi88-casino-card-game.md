#  What is the objective of Fi88 casino card game?

The goal of Fi88 casino card game is to score as many points as possible. Points are earned by taking cards that add up to totals of fi88, or less. The player who reaches the target score first, or has the lowest score when the deck runs out, is the winner.

# How to play Fi88 casino card game?

There are three different ways to play Fi88 casino card game- with two players, three players, and four players.

For two players, each player is dealt six cards. The player with the highest card starts the game and play passes clockwise. On a playerâ€™s turn they draw one card from the deck and either keep it or put it into the discard pile. If they put it into the discard pile then they must pick up the top card of the discard pile. When they have either six cards in their hand or no cards that can be added to what they have to form a total of fi88 or less, they must lay down all their cards and end their turn. The other player then takes a turn. The first player to reach fi88 (or whatever target score has been agreed upon) is the winner.

For three players, each player is dealt five cards. Play passes left then right on each turn and follows the same rules as for two players. The first player to reach fi88 is the winner.

For four players, each player is dealt four cards. Play passes around in a clockwise fashion and follows the same rules as for two players, except that if a player has no cards remaining then they pull one from another player (the direction of play reverses for this). The first player to reach fi88 wins the game..

#  How are points scored in Fi88 casino card game?

In Fi88, the points are scored by the team who first reaches or exceeds 5,000 points. The game is played with a regular deck of 52 cards. Aces are worth 1 point, 2s through 10s are worth face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are each worth 10 points. After the first card is played, the player with the highest point value card plays again. If both players have the same card, the player with the highest rank card (Aces are high) plays again. The winner of that particular round then scores points equal to the number on their card multiplied by the number of rounds won in that particular hand. So if the first card was an Ace and the player then won two more rounds, they would score 6 points (1x3).

If neither player has another high card to play after the first round has been completed, then whichever player has the lowest-valued card must play again. This process continues until one side either reaches 5,000 or more points or runs out of cards. In cases where both teams reach 5,000 points at approximately the same time, the team with fewer cards remaining is declared the winner.

#  Is there a joker in Fi88 casino card game?

There is no joker in Fi88 casino card game. The game is played with a regular deck of 52 cards.

#  Can more than one player play Fi88 casino card game?

Fi88 casino card game can be played by more than one player. In fact, it is often played by two players. The object of the game is to score points by taking as many tricks as possible. Each player is dealt a hand of six cards. The player who takes the most tricks wins the game.

The first thing you need to do is decide who will be the dealer. The dealer shuffles the deck and deals six cards to each player, face down. The remaining cards are placed in the middle of the players, face down. 
Then, the dealer turns over the top card of their deck and sets it in front of themselves. This card is known as the widow. 
The player on the dealers left starts the bidding by bidding any number of points they want to win this hand. The next player then bids higher or passes. This continues until there is a bidder or all other players have passed. If all other players pass, then the bidder automatically wins and takes all the tricks.
If there is more than one other player, then the highest bidder takes all but one trick from each other player (scoring points for taking those tricks) and scores 1 point for winning any leftover trick(s). The bidder also takes the widow (unless someone else has already taken it). If two or more players tie for highest bidder, then each scores 1 point for every trick taken from any other player (includes taking tricks from opponents as well as partners), including taking tricks from opponents as well as partners). In addition, if any player took all six tricks, that player scores an additional 3 points, for a total of 4 points. The first team to reach 21 (or more) points, wins the game!

#  If a player has 21 points, what happens?

If a player has 21 points in the game of blackjack, they are said to have busted. This means that they have gone over 21 and have lost the game. The dealer will usually take the player's bet and give them their cards back. Some casinos may instead choose to confiscate the player's bet and cards.
