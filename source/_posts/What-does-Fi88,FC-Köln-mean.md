The following year, they made it to the semi-finals of the European Cup where they played Real Madrid but lost 5-3 on aggregate.

1. FC Köln has had a number of its own superstars over the years, including Wolfgang Overath, Fritz Walter, Albert Gerland, Hannes Löhr, Konrad Weise and Horst Hrubesch. Wolfgang Overath even went on to become coach after his playing career came to an end.
