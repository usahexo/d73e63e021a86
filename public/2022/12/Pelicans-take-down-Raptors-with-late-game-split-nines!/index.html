        <h1 id="Pelicans-take-down-Raptors-with-late-game-split-nines"><a href="#Pelicans-take-down-Raptors-with-late-game-split-nines" class="headerlink" title="Pelicans take down Raptors with late game split nines!"></a>Pelicans take down Raptors with late game split nines!</h1><p>In a matchup of two of the best teams in the Eastern Conference, the Pelicans were able to take down the Raptors with some clutch shooting down the stretch.</p>
<p>Led by Nikola Mirotic’s 25 points and 9 rebounds, the Pelicans were able to withstand a Raptors comeback in the 4th quarter. Jrue Holiday also chipped in 19 points and 10 assists in the victory.</p>
<p>For Toronto, Kawhi Leonard led all scorers with 31 points on 11-for-22 shooting, but it wasn’t enough to overcome New Orleans’ late game surge. Serge Ibaka contributed 21 points and 12 rebounds for the Raptors.</p>
<p>The win moves New Orleans into a tie for 3rd place in the East with Philadelphia, while Toronto falls to 5th place. Both teams have now clinched playoff berths and will look to secure home court advantage in their respective first round matchups.</p>
<h1 id="Anthony-Davis-leads-Pelicans-to-victory-with-dramatic-split-nines"><a href="#Anthony-Davis-leads-Pelicans-to-victory-with-dramatic-split-nines" class="headerlink" title="Anthony Davis leads Pelicans to victory with dramatic split nines!"></a>Anthony Davis leads Pelicans to victory with dramatic split nines!</h1><p>In a game that had playoff intensity, Anthony Davis came up big for the Pelicans, leading them to victory with some amazing split nines!</p>
<p>The Pelicans were clinging to a one-point lead with just seconds left on the clock, and Davis took control, splitting the defense with two incredible shots at the rim. That gave the Pelicans a four-point lead and sealed the victory.</p>
<p>It was an impressive performance by Davis, who finished the game with 33 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. Jrue Holiday also played well for the Pelicans,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> scoring 27 points on 11-of-18 shooting.</p>
<p>For the Blazers, Damian Lillard led the way with 34 points and 11 assists. CJ McCollum added 28 points, and Al-Farouq Aminu scored 16 points off the bench.</p>
<p>This was a huge win for New Orleans, who now have a 3-2 lead in their first-round series against Portland. The next game is on Friday in New Orleans.</p>
<h1 id="Pelicans-overcome-Raptors-with-clutch-split-nines-play"><a href="#Pelicans-overcome-Raptors-with-clutch-split-nines-play" class="headerlink" title="Pelicans overcome Raptors with clutch split nines play!"></a>Pelicans overcome Raptors with clutch split nines play!</h1><p>NEW ORLEANS - Down by three points with just seconds to play, the New Orleans Pelicans executed a flawless nine-point play to take home the victory on their home court.</p>
<p>It all started when Nikola Mirotic got fouled on a desperation three-pointer with 2.6 seconds left on the clock. He calmly stepped to the line and drained all three foul shots to get the Pelicans within one point of the Raptors.</p>
<p>Anthony Davis was then able to get free in the corner off a quick inbounds pass, and he knocked down a triple to give New Orleans their first lead of the game.</p>
<p>Kyle Lowry had a chance to tie things up for Toronto, but his jumper rimmed out at the buzzer, giving the Pelicans a 107-104 win.</p>
<p>“That was a huge play,” said Davis after the game. “Nikola hit those big free throws, and then Anthony hit that huge three to give us the lead. We were able to close it out from there.”</p>
<p>Mirotic led all scorers with 27 points on 9-of-14 shooting, while Davis added 25 points and 11 rebounds. DeMar DeRozan led Toronto with 26 points.</p>
<h1 id="Split-nines-propel-Pelicans-to-big-win-over-the-Raptors"><a href="#Split-nines-propel-Pelicans-to-big-win-over-the-Raptors" class="headerlink" title="Split nines propel Pelicans to big win over the Raptors!"></a>Split nines propel Pelicans to big win over the Raptors!</h1><p>The New Orleans Pelicans used a dominant second half to propel themselves to a 128-116 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Saturday night. The Raptors were in control for most of the game, but the Pelicans turned up the heat in the fourth quarter and outscored Toronto 36-23 to secure the victory.</p>
<p>Anthony Davis led the way for New Orleans with 34 points and 17 rebounds, while Nikola Mirotic added 32 points and 11 rebounds. Kyle Lowry led Toronto with 30 points and 11 assists, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the surge from the Pelicans in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>The win was a big one for New Orleans, who has now won two straight games and four of their last six. The Raptors, meanwhile, have now lost two straight games and three of their last four.</p>
<p>Here are three takeaways from New Orleans’ big win over Toronto:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Pelicans dominated in the second half</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the keys to New Orleans’ victory was their dominance in the second half. After trailing by as many as nine points at halftime, they outscored Toronto 62-51 in the second half to pull away for good.</p>
<p>Davis was a major factor in that surge, scoring 24 points after halftime. Mirotic was also huge down the stretch, scoring 16 points in the fourth quarter alone. Combined, they were virtually unstoppable down the stretch and led New Orleans to an impressive victory.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The Raptors couldn’t slow down Davis or Mirotic</li>
</ol>
<p>Toronto had no answer for Davis or Mirotic on Saturday night. Davis finished with 34 points on 14-of-27 shooting, while Mirotic drilled 10-of-18 shots from the field en route to 32 points. They were simply too much for Toronto to handle and led New Orleans to a comfortable win.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Raptors need to bounce back soon</li>
</ol>
<p>Losing back-to-back games is never a good sign, but it’s especially concerning for Toronto when they’re facing teams like New Orleans who are battling for playoff positioning. The Raptors need to regroup quickly and get back on track if they want to stay competitive in a tight Eastern Conference race.</p>
<h1 id="Pelicans-use-split-nines-to-beat-the-Raptors"><a href="#Pelicans-use-split-nines-to-beat-the-Raptors" class="headerlink" title="Pelicans use split nines to beat the Raptors"></a>Pelicans use split nines to beat the Raptors</h1><p>The New Orleans Pelicans used a split nine strategy to beat the Toronto Raptors. With DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis both in the game, the Pelicans were able to take advantage of their size and athleticism.</p>
<p>Davis was particularly impressive, scoring 42 points and grabbing 19 rebounds. Cousins added 23 points and 10 rebounds. The Raptors were led by DeMar DeRozan, who scored 37 points.</p>
<p>The Pelicans’ victory extends their winning streak to six games and improves their record to 17-18. The Raptors fall to 24-10 with the loss.</p>
